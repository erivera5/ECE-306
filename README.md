# ECE 306: Introduction to Embedded Systems

This repository consists of C files that I worked on for a project throughout the Spring 2020 semester. The goal of the project was to design a microcontroller-based remote controlled car using C programs to control input/output peripherals. The C files included in this repository includes code that would allow this embedded system to be operated via serial communication using ASCII characters transmitted by an external device. The code allows for the vehicle to move in forward, left, right, and reverse directions for a period of time determined by the user. An IR Emitter LED could also be enabled, which allowed for the ADC converter involved with this project to detect a black line and ultimately have the vehicle automatically traverse it.

In the interest of preserving academic integrity, the code listings for this project may not be made available for public online viewing.
