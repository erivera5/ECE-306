# ECE 306: Introduction to Embedded Systems

In the interest of preserving the academic integrity of current or future ECE 306 students, the code listings for this project may not be made available for public online viewing. These files are contained in a private repository.

## Overview

The goal of the project was to design a IOT controllable RC car, and write software to control the vehicle over a Wi-Fi connection and autonomously follow a black electrical tape line. Software was written in C, within the IAR Embedded Workbench IDE, to control the input/output peripherals of the TI-MSP430 microcontroller. This software included code and algorithms that implemented a handful of other features, such as traveling in a specified shape, manually configuring the MSP430's UART baud rate, and even a menu system displayed on an LCD screen mounted on the vehicle.
